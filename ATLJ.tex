We define a truncated tensor product $\boxtimes$ of ATLJ modules, which is the usual tensor product, modulo the relations that
any closed diagram passes through a string, and
the $2\pi$ rotation acts identically.

Observe that if $V$ and $W$ are sub-ATLJ modules of a evaluable planar algebra $\cP_\bullet$, the ATLJ homomorphism $V \otimes W \to \cP_\bullet$ descends to an ATLJ homomorphism $V \boxtimes W \to \cP_\bullet$, because the additional relations we impose in the truncated tensor product automatically hold in an evaluable planar algebra.

We now aim to completely describe the decomposition of this truncated tensor product into irreducibles. 
To prepare for this, we need some discussion of lowest weight vectors in ATLJ modules.

Recall the isomorphism classes of minimal idempotents in the Temperley-Lieb-Jones algebra are the Jones-Wenzl idempotents $f^{(n)}$. 
It is convenient to pass to the idempotent completion, and consider the TLJ algebra as a semisimple category with simple objects $f^{(n)}$. 
The annular Temperley-Lieb-Jones category contains as a full subcategory the category with objects \nn{circle with one marked point, labelled by fn} which we call the tube category $\cT$. This inclusion is a Morita equivalence, giving an equivalence between $\Rep(ATLJ)$ and $\Rep(\cT)$. This is explained in \cite[Proposition 3.5]{1502.06543}.

\nn{Some remarks about what irreps of $\cT$ look like, and that there's only one annular consequence of the generator in each higher weight space.}

Suppose $\cV$ is some $\cT$ module.

\begin{lem}
When $\delta>2$, the lowest weight vectors in $\cV_m$ are the kernel of $\cL_m : \cV_m \to \cV_m$
$$
\cL_m = \mathfig{0.2}{LowestWeightTangle}.
$$
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
First, it is clear that the lowest weight vectors are the kernel of $a$, where $$\mathfig{0.2}{LoweringOperator}.$$

Certainly $\ker(a)\subset\ker(\cL_m)$.
To show the other direction, we look at a basis of eigenvectors for $\cL_m$ acting on $\cV_m$ consisting of the new low weights, together with the annular consequences of previous low weights.  
$$
\mathfig{0.4}{PreviousLowWeightsInW}.
$$
By \cite[Proposition 5.3]{1502.06543}, as long as $\delta > 2$, $\cL_m$ has non-zero eigenvalue on the annular consequence.  Therefore only the uncappable vectors can be in the $Ker(\cL_m)$.
\end{proof}

$$\text{if $x>0$}$$

We then define the two operators $\rho, \rho' : \cV_m \to \cV_m$ as
$$
\mathfig{0.3}{CutDownRotation}.
$$


\begin{lem}
The lowest weight vectors with rotational eigenvalue $\omega$ in $\cV_m$ can alternatively be characterized as the solutions of 
\begin{align*}
\rho(v) & = \omega v \\
\rho'(v) & = \omega^{-1} v.
\end{align*}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
First we expand the middle Jones-Wenzl idempotent in 
$$
\mathfig{0.3}{RhoRhoPrime}
$$
into a linear combination of Temperley-Lieb-Jones diagrams. 
Only the identity diagram and the diagram
$$
\mathfig{0.2}{JonesProjection}
$$
contribute, and we obtain
$
\rho \circ \rho' = \id_{W_m} - [m-1]/[m] \cL_m
$.
If $v$ is a eigenvector with eigenvalue $\omega$, then $$\rho \circ \rho'(v)=v-[m-1]/[m] \cL_m (v),$$ so $\cL_m(v)=0$, and $v$ is uncappable.
The converse is trivial.
\end{proof}


\begin{defn}
Consider irreducible $\cT$ modules $V^{n_+, \omega_+}$ and $V^{n_-, \omega_-}$, with lowest weight generators $S_+$ and $S_-$. (The use of $\pm$ as a label here has nothing to do with shadings; it's just convenient for our later formulas.) Fix $m\geq 0$ such that $n_+ + n_- + m = 0 \pmod 2$,
and define for $0 \leq i \leq \lfloor (m-2)/2 \rfloor$ and $0 \leq j < m - 2i$ 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:basis-elements}
T_{i,j} & = \mathfig{0.2}{Tij_generic}
\end{align}
where $k_i = (n_+ + n_- - m)/2 + i$. Here \nn{the squiggle lines just mean vertical strands.}
It will be helpful in what follows to consider $j \pmod{m-2i}$, because we are insisting that $2\pi$ rotations act trivially.

If $n_+ \neq n_-$ we need to properly interpret some special cases. We mean
\begin{align*}
T_{i,j} & = 
\begin{cases}
\mathfig{0.16}{Tij_right} & \text{when $n_- \leq k_i < n_+$, and} \\
\mathfig{0.16}{Tij_left} & \text{when $n_+ \leq k_i < n_-$.}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
\end{defn}

\begin{fact}
A basis for $\left(V^{n_+, \omega_+} \boxtimes V^{n_-, \omega_-}\right)_m$ is given by $\{T_{i,j}\}$ for $0 \leq i \leq \lfloor (m-2)/2 \rfloor$ and $0 \leq i < m - 2i$.
\end{fact}

\begin{lem}
Consider irreducible $\cT$ modules $V^{n_+, \omega_+}$ and $V^{n_-, \omega_-}$, and let $U=V^{n_+, \omega_+} \boxtimes V^{n_-, \omega_-}$.
Let $W_m$ be the space of uncappable vectors in $U_m$.
Then $$\dim(W_m)=\begin{cases} m & \text{if $n_+ + n_- + m = 0 \pmod 2$, and} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise.}\end{cases}$$
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Let $\gA_m(S)$ be the space of $\cT$-annular consequences of $S$ in $U_m$.

Assume for now that $n_+ = n_- \pmod 2$, and that $m$ is even. \nn{The other case is similar.}
We use the basis for $U_m$ described above, to count dimensions.
It's now straightforward that $\dim(U_m)=m+\dim(U_{m-2})$, since
$$
U_{m}
=
\gA_m(W_0)\oplus\cdots\oplus \gA_m(W_{m-2})\oplus W_m 
= 
\gA_m(U_{m-2})\oplus W_m
$$
Note that $U_{2}=W_{2}$ since $W_{0}$ is the ``trivial'' representation. 
By induction on $m$, it suffices to show that $\dim(W_{2})=2$.  
This follows from direct computation.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
Consider irreducible $\cT$ modules $V^{n_+, \omega_+}$ and $V^{n_-, \omega_-}$, with lowest weight generators $S_+$ and $S_-$.
The truncated tensor product decomposes as
$$
V^{n_+, \omega_+} \boxtimes V^{n_-, \omega_-} 
\iso 
\bigoplus_{\substack{m \geq 0 \\ \text{$m + n_+  + n_-$ is even} \\ \omega^m = 1}} V^{m, \omega},
$$
with low weight generators 
$$
X_{m, \omega} 
= 
\sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor\frac{m-2}{2}\rfloor}
\sum_{j=0}^{m- 2i - 1} 
(c_{m,\omega})_{i,j} T_{i,j}
$$
where $T_{i,j}$ is as defined in Equation \eqref{eq:basis-elements}, and the $(c_{m,\omega})_{i,j}$ are determined by the equations
\begin{align*}
\todo{}
\end{align*}
in the case that $m \leq n_1 + n_2$, and are determined by the equations
\begin{align*}
\todo{}
\end{align*}
in the case that $m > n_1 + n_2$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
We apply $\rho$ to $T_{i,j}$ and expand the lower Jones-Wenzl idempotent.
$$
\rho(T_{j,i})=
\mathfig{0.2}{RhoTij}
$$
Certainly the identity term contributes, and the only place we can put a cup on top is the top right.
Because the top right cup will result in an extra strand passing around the bottom of the diagram, no matter where we put a cap along the bottom of the expansion of the Jones-Wenzl idempotent, the total number of strands around the bottom cannot decrease. 
Thus the terms $T_{i',j'}$ which appear in $\rho(T_{i,j})$ can never have $i'<i$.

We first discuss the identity term in the expansion of the lower Jones-Wenzl idempotent. When $i > 0$, we end up with a cup attached to the upper Jones-Wenzl, giving zero. When $i=0$, we obtain $T_{0,j+1}$. We thus write this contribution as $\truth{i=0} T_{i, j+1}$, where here and below we use the notation $\truth{P} = 1$ if $P$ is true, $\truth{P} = 0$ otherwise.

In general there are four different places the cap could appear along the bottom edge of the Jones-Wenzl idempotent. Three of these are between an adjacent pair of the four multistrands connecting to the bottom edge of that idempotent. The fourth is within either the 2nd or 3rd multistrand, in the position so that it bridges between $S_+$ and $S_-$, or in the special case that $k_i < n_+$ or $k_i < n_i$, that cap wraps around behind the completely connected generator.
We can thus have
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
\label{item:purple}
\textcolor{purple}{
a cap appearing with $i-1$ strands to the left, between the first multistrand and the next,
}
\item
\label{item:orange}
\textcolor{orange}{
a cap appearing with $i+j-1$ strands to the left, between the second and third multstrands,
}
\item
\label{item:red}
\textcolor{red}{
a cap appearing with $m-i-1$ strands to the left, between the third and fourth multistrands, or
}
\item
\label{item:green}
\textcolor{DarkGreen}{
a `bridging' cap appearing with $i+j+n_+-k_i -1$ strands to the left, which lies within either the second or third multistrand.
}
\end{enumerate}
(The colour coding of these cases is used throughout the formulas below, to indicate terms arising from each of these possibilities.)

Note that if $i=0$, cases \eqref{item:purple} and \eqref{item:red} cannot occur, while if $j=0$ case \eqref{item:orange} cannot occur. Moreover, in case \eqref{item:purple} above we have been careful to say that the cap occurs between the first multistrand and \emph{the next} multistrand, because in special cases the next multistrand is not the second one. In particular, when $j=0$, the cap actually connects the first multistrand with the third, because the second is absent. The third multistrand, with $m-2i-j$ strands, is never absent, so this is the only special case of this type.

Finally, the bridging cap in case \eqref{item:green} occurs within the second multistrand exactly if $m-2i-j < n_+ - k_i$ or equivalently $m-n_+-n_-< 2j$, and within the third multistrand exactly if $m-2i-j > n_+ - k_i$, or equivalently when $m-n_+-n_->2j$. When equality occurs, we must remember to omit this case, because it is redundant with case \eqref{item:orange}, the cap between the second and third multistrands.

We now analyze the resulting diagram in each of the four cases, ignoring for now the coefficients arising in the Jones-Wenzl idempotent. As there is always a cup in the top right corner of the Temperley-Lieb diagram, there is an extra strand passing around the bottom of the diagram, thereby increasing $i$ by one.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
\textcolor{purple}{
a cap between the first multistrand and the next has the effect of reducing both $i$ and $j$, in net producing $T_{i,j-1}$ (one needs to consider carefully that this is still true when $j=0$, that is, the second multistrand is absent; recall we consider $j \pmod{m-2i}$, because of $2\pi$ rotational invariance),
}
\item
\textcolor{orange}{
a cap between the second and third multistrands reduces $j$, producing $T_{i+1, j-1}$, \nn{except with the stars in the wrong places, introducing some sigmas; nasty in the totally connected cases??}
}
\item
\textcolor{red}{
a cap between the third and fourth multistrands reduces $i$ but increases $j$, producing $T_{i, j+1}$, and finally
}
\item
\textcolor{DarkGreen}{
the bridging cap (when it is distinct from case \eqref{item:orange}) reduces $j$ by two when it lies within the second multistrand, and does not change $j$ when it lies within the third multistrand, producing $T_{i+1, j - 2\truth{m-n_+-n_- < 2j}}$. 
}
\end{enumerate}

In each of the cases above, we interpret $T_{i,j}$ as zero if $i$ becomes too large, that is $i > \lfloor (m-2)/2 \rfloor$. (This is of course justified by our having imposed that closed diagrams move freely, so the resulting $T_{i,j}$ has a Jones-Wenzl idempotent with cups attached to it.)

To compute the expansion of the Jones-Wenzl idempotent, we quickly recall
\begin{lem}
The coefficient of the following Temperley-Lieb diagram in the Jones-Wenzl idempotent $\jw{m}$ is given by
%\begin{align*}
%\underset{\in \jw{m}}{\textrm{coeff}}
%\left(
%\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline = -.1cm, yscale=-.5]
%	\draw (-.5,-.8)--(-.5,.8);
%	\draw (-.3,.8) arc (-180:0:.2cm);
%	\draw (-.3,-.8)--(.3,.8);
%	\draw (-.1,-.8) arc (180:0:.2cm);
%	\draw (.5,-.8)--(.5,.8);
%	\node at (-.7,0) {{\scriptsize{$a$}}};
%	\node at (-.2,0) {{\scriptsize{$b$}}};
%	\node at (.7,0) {{\scriptsize{$c$}}};
%\end{tikzpicture}
%\right)
%& =
%(-1)^{b+1}\frac{[a+1][c+1]}{[m]}
%\end{align*}
%{and the coefficient is the same applying any $\bbZ/2\bbZ $-symmetry, and in particular}
\begin{align*}
\underset{\in \jw{m}}{\textrm{coeff}}
\left(
\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline = -.1cm, yscale=-.5]
	\draw (-.5,-.8)--(-.5,.8);
	\draw (-.3,.8) arc (-180:0:.2cm);
	\draw (-.3,-.8)--(.3,.8);
	\draw (-.1,-.8) arc (180:0:.2cm);
	\node at (-.7,0) {{\scriptsize{$a$}}};
	\node at (-.2,0) {{\scriptsize{$b$}}};
    \node at (.2,0) {$\phantom{c}$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\right)
& =
(-1)^{m-a+1}\frac{[a+1]}{[m]}.
\end{align*}
\end{lem}


Putting all this together, we obtain the formula
\begin{align*}
\rho(T_{i,j}) & =
\truth{i = 0} T_{i, j + 1} \\
& \qquad +
\truth{i \neq 0} \textcolor{purple}{(-1)^{m-i} [i][m]^{-1}} T_{i,j-1} \\
& \qquad +
\truth{j \neq 0}\textcolor{orange}{(-1)^{m-i-j} [i+j][m]^{-1}} \nn{sigmas} T_{i+1, j-1} \\
& \qquad +
\truth{i \neq 0}\textcolor{red}{(-1)^{i}  [m-i][m]^{-1}} T_{i, j + 1} \\
& \qquad +
\truth{m-n_+-n_-\neq 2j} \textcolor{DarkGreen}{(-1)^{(m - n_+ + n_-)/2 + j} [(m + n_+ - n_-)/2 + j][m]^{-1}} T_{i+1,j-2\truth{m-n_+-n_- < 2j}}
\end{align*}

Happily, some simplifications occur here. In the second term, we can omit the $\truth{i\neq0}$ factor, since the quantum integer $[0]$ is zero. The first term (corresponding to the identity term in the expansion of the Jones-Wenzl idempotent) and the fourth term (corresponding to case \eqref{item:red}, a cap connecting the third and fourth multistrands) can be combined to give $(-1)^i [m-i][m]^{-1} T_{i,j+1}$. Splitting the final term into two cases, we have
\begin{align*}
\rho(T_{i,j}) & =
T_{i, j + 1} \\
& \qquad +
\textcolor{purple}{(-1)^{m-i} [i][m]^{-1}} T_{i,j-1} \\
& \qquad +
\truth{j \neq 0}\textcolor{orange}{(-1)^{m-i-j} [i+j][m]^{-1}} \nn{sigmas} T_{i+1, j-1} \\
& \qquad +
\textcolor{DarkGreen}{(-1)^{(m - n_+ + n_-)/2 + j} [(m + n_+ - n_-)/2 + j][m]^{-1}} \times \\
& \qquad \qquad \times \Big(
\truth{m-n_+-n_- < 2j}  T_{i+1,j-2} + \truth{m-n_+-n_- > 2j} T_{i+1,j}
\Big)
\end{align*}


\nn{Can we find the formulas for $\rho'$ just using the reflection in a vertical line?}

Writing $\cT_i = \Span \{ T_{i,j} \}_{0 \leq j < m- 2i}$, we can write $\rho \mid_{\cT_i} = \mu_i + \nu_i$, where
\begin{align*}
\mu_i : & \cT_i \to \cT_i \\
 & T_{i,j} \mapsto T_{i,j+1} + (-1)^{m-i}[i][m]^{-1} T_{i,j-1} \\
\intertext{and}
\nu_i : & \cT_i \to \cT_{i+1}.
\end{align*}
In fact, $\mu_i$ is just a circulant matrix in this basis, and so has multiplicity free eigenvalues
$$\lambda_r = (-1)^{m-i}[i][m]^{-1} \zeta_{m-2i}^r + \zeta_{m-2i}^{-r},$$
where $\zeta_{m-2i}$ is a primitive $(m-2i)$-th root of unity, with corresponding eigenvalues
$$v_r = \left(1, \zeta_{m-2i}^r , \zeta_{m-2i}^{2r} , \ldots, \zeta_{m-2i}^{(m-2i-1)r} \right).$$

Clearly when $i = 0$, these eigenvalues are exactly the $m$-th roots of unity, each of multiplicity one.

\nn{Hope: when $i \neq 0$, the eigenvalues are never $m$-th roots of unity (sadly, they do sometimes have absolute value 1). I don't see how to prove this, perhaps it would require number theory?}
\nn{This is false, ugh, there are weird special values where this can happen, see Mathematica notebook.}

We thus have a unique solution to $\rho(X) = \zeta_m^r X$ for each $r$, given by $X = \sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor(m-2)/2\rfloor} X_i$, with
\begin{align*}
X_0 & = \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \zeta^{-rj} T_{i,j} \\
\intertext{and}
X_{i+1} & = - (\mu_{i+1} - \zeta_m^r)^{-1} \nu_i X_i.
\end{align*}


\nn{begin old stuff...}

When $j=0$, there are either 1 or 2 places for a cap on the bottom, depending on the value of $i$, and the identity term in the Jones-Wenzl idempotent also contributes.
$$
\rho(T^\pm_{0,i}) = 
\begin{cases}
T^\pm_{0,1}
+\textcolor{DarkGreen}{(-1)^{m-n_\mp+k_0}[n_\mp-k_0][m]^{-1}} T^\pm_{1,0}&\text{if $i=0$}
\\
T^\pm_{0,i+1}
+\textcolor{DarkGreen}{(-1)^{m-n_\mp+k_0-i}[i+n_\mp-k_0][m]^{-1}} T^\pm_{1,i} +
\\ \qquad + \textcolor{orange}{(-1)^{m-i} \sigma^{-1}_\mp\sigma_\pm [i][m]^{-1}} T^\pm_{1,i-1}
&\text{if }0 < i <n_\pm-k_j-1

\\ \qquad +\textcolor{orange}{(-1)^{m-(n_\pm-k_0-1)} \sigma^{-1}_\mp\sigma_\pm [n_\pm-k_0-1][m]^{-1} } T^\pm_{1,n_\pm-k_0-2}
&\text{if } i = n_\pm-k_0-1
\end{cases}
$$

Now since $j$ can only increase by applying $\rho$, we see that the coefficient of $T^m_{0,i+1}$ in $X_{m,\omega}$ must be $\omega^{-1}$ times the coefficient of $T^m_{0,i}$.

When $0<j<j_{\text{max}}$, there are 
either 3 or 4 places for a cap on the bottom, depending on $i$, and the identity term in the Jones-Wenzl idempotent does \emph{not} contribute.
\todo{fix below here...}
$$
\rho(T^\pm_{j,i}) = 
\begin{cases}
\textcolor{purple}{(-1)^{m-j}\cdot \sigma_\pm^{-k_j}\sigma_\mp^{k_j} [j][m]^{-1}} T^\mp_{j,n_\mp-k_j-1}

Let's try and match up the special cases.
The first case to look at is when $j=0$ and $i$ is generic.
When $j=0$, the purple term vanishes.
The first term looks like the red term.

Now we need to look at the non-generic $i$ case.
The orange case matches.
Let's look at the green case.
Since $n_\pm-k_j-1$ is out of range for $j+1$ (it's important to remember that $k_j$ was defined in terms of $j$, not $j+1$!), we must interpret
$$
T^\pm_{j+1,n_\pm-k_j-1} = \sigma_\pm^{-k_{j+1}}\sigma_\mp^{k_{j+1}} T^\mp_{j+1,0}
$$
With this definition, the green terms match.
Let's do the red case.
Since $i+1=n_\pm-k_j$ is out of range for $j$, we must interpret
$$
T^\pm_{j,n_\pm-k_j} = \sigma_\pm^{-k_{j}}\sigma_\mp^{k_{j}} T^\mp_{j,0}
$$
Note that this is the same formula as we wrote down before!
Now the red case matches.
Finally, we have to look at the purple case.
Here, the non-generic case is $i=0$.
Since $i=-1$ is out of range, we must interpret
$$
T^\pm_{j,-1} = \sigma_\pm^{-k_{j}}\sigma_\mp^{k_{j}} T^\mp_{j,n_\mp-k_j-1}
$$
Now the purple cases match.
\\
\\
Now we only have to worry about $j_{\text{max}}$.
This will inevitably lead us to the case below.

Generic formula for $S_\mp$ fully connected to $S_\pm$:
\begin{align*}
\rho(T^\pm_{j,i}) 
&= 
\textcolor{purple}{(-1)^{m-j}[j]/[m]} T^\pm_{j,i-1}
+\textcolor{orange}{(-1)^{m-i-j} [i+j]/[m] } T^\pm_{j+1,i-1}
%+\textcolor{DarkGreen}{(-1)^{m-i-j-n_{\mp}+k_j}[i+j+n_{\mp}-k_j]/[m]} T^\pm_{j+1,i}
+\textcolor{red}{(-1)^j [m-j]/[m]} T^\pm_{j,i+1}
\end{align*}
\nn{
The generic formula here never has any $\sigma$'s, since the region with the $*$'s are locked.
Moreover, there's no going back and forth between $+$ and $-$, since the position of the $S_\pm$ are locked.
This case only comes about with $n_+\neq n_-$.

\textbf{Corey's Suggestion:}  I propose the following notation, with the goal of avoiding the ``symmetric tensor product" as per Scott's suggestion.  We revert to the old notation of $T_{j,i}$ with no $\pm$ superscript, for $0\le i\le n_{+}+n_{-}-2k_{j}-1$.  No planar isotopies allowed here, except 360 rotation equals identity.  Then define:

\medskip

$R^{+}_{j,i}:=T_{j,i}$ for $0\le i\le n_{+}-k_{j}-1$, and $R^{-}_{j,i}:=T_{j,n_{+}-k_{j}+i}$ for $0\le i\le n_{-}-k_{j}-1$.

We interpret $R^{+}_{j,n_{+}-k_{j}}=R^{-}_{j,0}$ and $R^{-}_{j,n_{-}-k_{j}}=R^{+}_{j,0}$.  This is similar to what we had before but no powers of $\sigma_{\pm}^{k_j}$ in sight!  The explanation of why these disappear is that these come from the implementation of the braiding in the symmetrization, which we are trying to avoid for simplicities sake.  Then the full formula (including generic and special cases) is given by:
 
 \begin{align*}
\rho(R^\pm_{j,i}) 
&= 
\textcolor{purple}{(-1)^{m-j}[j]/[m]} R^\pm_{j,i-1}
+\textcolor{orange}{(-1)^{m-i-j} \sigma^{-1}_\mp\sigma_\pm [i+j]/[m] } R^\pm_{j+1,i-1}
\\ &\qquad
+\textcolor{DarkGreen}{(-1)^{m-i-j-n_{\mp}+k_j}[i+j+n_{\mp}-k_j]/[m]} R^\pm_{j+1,i}
+\textcolor{red}{(-1)^j [m-j]/[m]} R^\pm_{j,i+1}
\end{align*}
 
With the interpretation above, this restricts to the non-generic cases.  This gives us a complete universal formula for the cases where the generator $S_{-}$ is not fully attached to $S_{+}$, and applying $\rho$ does not yield such a case.

$S_{-}$ being fully attached to $S_{+}$ is determined by $j$.  Assume that $n_{-}<n_{+} $. Then such situations are given by $\frac{1}{2}(m-2)\ge j\ge \frac{1}{2}(m-n_{+}+n_{-})$ (note the left bound is the largest possible value of j).  In this situation, there are $m-2j$ strings attached from $S_{+}$ to the Jones-Wenzl $f_{m}$, and the rotations don't need a plus or minus, so we interpret $R_{j,i}=R^{\pm}_{j,i}=R^{\mp}_{j,i}$ , where $0\le i <m-{2j}$, and values of $i$ can be interpreted mod $m-2j$. 

We consider first the case where $j=\frac{1}{2}(m-n_{+}+n_{-})+1$, so that apply $\rho$ will yield terms in this ``fully" attached case.  But inspection shows that the generic formula for the higher case applies with our given interpretation!!! So this is not actually a special case!



Now we have the formula for the cases $\frac{1}{2}(m-1)\ge j\ge \frac{1}{2}(m-n_{+}+n_{-})$ is given by

\begin{align*}
\rho(R_{j,i}) 
&= 
\textcolor{purple}{(-1)^{m-j}[j]/[m]} R_{j,i-1}
+\textcolor{orange}{(-1)^{m-i-j} [i+j]/[m] } R_{j+1,i-1}
%+\textcolor{DarkGreen}{(-1)^{m-i-j-n_{\mp}+k_j}[i+j+n_{\mp}-k_j]/[m]} T^\pm_{j+1,i}
+\textcolor{red}{(-1)^j [m-j]/[m]} R_{j,i+1}
\end{align*}

We simply have to interpret $R_{j,i}=0$ for $j>\frac{1}{2}(m-1)$, and we are finished.  To reiterate, a final formula is given by the above two, so our many cased thing. 

\todo{Independently verify the above things are correct}

Now, want to solve equation for $X_{\omega}=\sum_{j,i} c^{\pm}_{j,i}R^{\pm}_{j,i}$, $\rho(X_{\omega})=\omega X_{\omega}$.  Notice that our formula shows that normalizing $c_{0,0}=1$, $c_{0,i}=\omega^{-i}$.  Similarly the coefficients of $j$-max are determined.  While it may be possible that there is a unique solution just based on this equation alone (i.e. combining top down determination with bottom up determination), my original way to solve these equations was to look at the action of $\rho^{\prime}$ on these basis vectors.

\todo{Write down equations for action of $\rho^{\prime}$}

You get the same type of equations but the coefficients are replaced a nice $m-$ whatever they were symmetry.  This should yield enough information to solve exclusively from the top down recursively. 




\end{proof}



We'll take a low weight $S$ with $2n$ strings on the top, with a 1-click rotational eigenvalue of  $\sigma$. 

Define the elements $T_{j,i}$, which are a basis for the  $f_{2n+2}$ cut down of the weight $2n+2$ space in $V \boxtimes V$

$$
T_{j,i} = \mathfig{0.2}{Tij}
$$

For $\omega$ a $(2n+2)^{\text{th}}$ root of unity, let

$$X_{\omega} = \sum_{j=0}^{n+1} \sum_{i=0}^{2n+2-2j} c^{\omega}_{j,i} T_{j,i}$$

be the (unique up to scale) low weight vector in $(V \boxtimes V)_{2n+2}$ with eigenvalue $\omega$.

Now suppose $S$ comes from an initial triple point, and we have *10 annular multiplicity sequence.

\begin{lem}
There is an ATLJ-module homomorphism $\mu: V\boxtimes V\rightarrow P$.
\end{lem}

Consequences:
Notice $\mu(T_{j,i})=0$ for $j>1$, because $P$ is $(n-1)$-supertransitive. 
 By $*10$ assumption, $\mu(X_{\omega})=0$.
If $S^{2}= r S + TLJ$, then $\mu(T_{1,i})=r \sigma^{i}$ (box 1-strand jellyfish).

From formula for $c^{\omega}_{j,i},\ c_{0,i}=\omega^{i} c^{\omega}_{0,0}$, and we can pick $c^{\omega}_{0,0} = 1$.

$\sum_{\omega} \mu(X_{\omega})=0$.
We could worry about the diagrams $\mu(T_{0,i})$, but these appear in $\mu(X_{\omega})$ with coefficient $c_{0,i}=\omega^{i}$.


Note, that for $i \neq 0 \pmod{2n+2}$, $\sum_{\omega} \omega^{i}=0$.

\begin{align*}
0 & = \sum_{\omega} \mu(X_{\omega}) \\
   & = \sum_{\omega, i} c^{\omega}_{0,i} \mu(T_{0,i}) + c^{\omega}_{1,i} \mu(T_{1,i}) \\
   & = \sum_i \left( \left(\sum_\omega \omega^i\right) \mu(T_{0,i}) + \sum_\omega c^{\omega}_{1,i} \mu(T_{1,i})\right) \\
   & = (2n+2) \mu(T_{0,0}) + r \left(\sum_i \left(\sum_\omega c^{\omega}_{1,i}\right) \sigma^{i}\right) (box 1-strand jellyfish)
\end{align*}

The upshot is that we have an equation:
$$
\mathfig{0.2}{QuadraticEqn.jpg}
$$

Step 1: Let’s assume there’s some constant $Q$ for the (?) above, and calculate a formula in terms of $Q$. 
\begin{itemize}
\item
Let’s expand the $(2n+2)$-strand JW, but not all the way, and equate coefficients of certain diagrams.
\item
We’re interested in calculating the coefficients on both sides of the following diagram:
$$
\mathfig{0.12}{SCupTopLeft.jpg}
$$
\item
On the left hand side, there’s only 2 diagrams we need the coefficients for:
$$
\mathfig{0.2}{JWCupTopLeft.jpg}
$$
The first is $-[2n+1]/[2n+2]$ and the second $(-1)^{2n+1}/[2n+2]$

\end{itemize}
